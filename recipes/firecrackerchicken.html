    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Firecracker chicken is very similar to sweet and sour chicken, only much spicier (hence the name) </p>
    <p> Browning the chicken keeps it moist and tender and if you serve it over rice, the heat is mellowed out.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>2/3 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
        <li>¾ cup honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place a rack in the center of the oven.</li>
        <li>Combine cornstarch, ginger, pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt in a large resealable bag or large bowl. Place beaten eggs in a large shallow bowl or dish. Add chicken to bag and shake to coat.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high until shimmering.</li>
        <li>While oil is heating, transfer 1/3 of the chicken to dish with eggs and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, stirring halfway through, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice and sprinkle with scallions and sesame seeds.</li>
 
    </ol>
